ISpec - Interface Specification
===============================

.. warning::

   ISpec is an **experimental** project, and is not aimed to be used in
   real projects. You can successfully create interfaces with the help
   of `abc <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`__ (on which
   *ispec* is based),
   `zope.interface <https://zopeinterface.readthedocs.io>`__, and last
   but not least, the best solution, the
   `Protocol <https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/>`__ from
   `typing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`__.

ISpec is a project aimed to create a simple way of defining interfaces.
